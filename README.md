# Math Partner
The objective of the project is to build a Complex Mathematics Question Solving App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app will allow users to search for complex mathematics problems and get instant solutions. Additionally, the app will feature a save function, allowing users to save specific problems and their solutions for later reference. The app's design will be responsive, making it accessible on various devices, including mobile phones and tablets. The primary aim of the project is to provide a user-friendly solution to a complex problem and make it easier for users to access complex mathematics solutions.
